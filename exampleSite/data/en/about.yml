  textabout : World leading researchers with more than twenty years of sucessfully building liquid xenon Dark Matter detectors unite forces in the XLZD Consortium
  textabout2 : We aim to design and build a single, common multi-ton experiment. Current detectors LZ and XENONnT have the same science goals but differ in many technical details.  We are able to explore and select the best option from both worlds, strengthening our R&D efforts by combining ideas and ressources
